Your task will be to build a classifier that can determine whether a sample is malignant or benign to help your colleague!\n","\n","Every patient that arrives at the hospital undergoes a biopsy of their tumor. This means that a small sample of the tumor is taken from the patient and various metrics are recorded about it, including: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. \n","\n","Using a large dataset of labeled biopsy samples from breast cancer tumors, you will build your binary classification model to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on these features.

Here's what a few of them mean:\n","\n","1. $Perimeter$: Total distance between points defining the cell's nuclear perimeter.\n","2. $Radius$: Average distance from the center of the cell's nucleus to its perimeter.\n","3. $Texture$: The texture of the cell nucleus is measured by finding the variance of the gray scale intensities in the component pixels.\n","4. $Area$: Nuclear area is measured by counting the number of pixels on the interior of the nucleus and adding one-half of the pixels in the perimeter.\n","\n","The following image should give a visual to what these cell nucleus features look like: \n","\n","![perimeter](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-U43OAojYbMY9gIlpvLHPNr3V2saqqHJ)\n","\n","5. $Smoothness$: Measures the smoothness of a nuclear contour by measuring the difference between the length of a radial line and the mean length of the lines surrounding it.
